# About

Our **_GECCO 2024 Workshop on Embodied and Evolved Artificial Intelligence (EEAI)_** ([Link](https://gecco-2024.sigevo.org/Workshops#EEAI)) will bring together a diverse group of academics from various fields such as AI, evolutionary computation, robotics, engineering. We will organise a workshop which will be open and welcome to researchers from the EC community and robotics community.

Embodied artificial intelligence is a cutting-edge field at the intersection of AI, robotics, and bioengineering, focuses on integrating artificial systems with intelligence for rich environmental interactions. It's driven by the philosophy of embodied cognition, asserting that true intelligence is linked with physical and social embodiment. 

This workshop aims to elucidate how the notion of embodiment as a design paradigm aligns with and enriches the entire domain of evolutionary computation. We are interested in several factors contributing to the embodied artificial intelligence, which include but not limited to the following:

  - Integration of evolutionary approaches with traditional design techniques.
  - Bio-inspired Soft Robot Evolution.
  - Embodied and mechanical intelligence in soft robots.
  - Real-world embodied AI through bio-inspired mechanisms.

A diverse group of invited speakers and panelists will delve into fundamental issues and emerging challenges in the field. The workshop will also feature an innovative **_show and tell_** demo session, designed to be fully interactive. Participants, including researchers, are encouraged to integrate their thematic demonstrations with those from the CSIRO Soft Robotics lab, fostering a collaborative and hands-on experience.

**_Contributed Papers_** will be presented in **_spotlight talks_** and during **_one poster sessions_**. We will seek submissions describing novel ideas and/or preliminary results, but also related works concerning EEAI that have been peer-reviewed and accepted by other top-tier journals and/or conferences. The latter allows workshop participants to learn about recent works that have been published in the field.

[//]: # (An **_online survey on TAS_** &#40;conducted before the event&#41; will complement the workshop. Results of the survey will be presented during the workshop and will guide the work of focus groups during the day. **_Focus groups will work towards a multidisciplinary taxonomy on various aspects and the emerging challenges for TAS_** which will be summarised in a workshop report and/or joint white paper. A particular focus of the working groups will be on the **_design, engineering, operation and regulation of TAS_**.)

Following the GECCO 2024 workshop on Embodied and Envolved Artificial Intelligence, we are plan to propose a **_Special Issue on EEAI_** in a relevant journal. This special issue aims to preserve and share the outcomes of teh workshop, including extended versions of the contributed papers, ensuring the workshop's impact extends beyond the event itself.


[//]: # (a potential **_Special Issue on EEAI_** in the [Journal of Responsible Technology]&#40;https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-responsible-technology&#41; will capture and disseminate the workshop outcomes including the results of the survey, the multidisciplinary taxonomy, and extended versions of the contributed papers. Thereby the workshop outcomes are preserved beyond the event. )

# Call for Papers

The workshop on **Embodied and Evolved Artificial Intelligence (EEAI)** aims to bring together academics from a wide range of disciplines and backgrounds and to drive discussion around the interactions between evolutionary computation and embodied cognition, using soft robotics as a touchpoint. We strive to catalyze research that fully explores the potential of embodied artificial intelligence as a problem-solving tool and philosophy. 

We welcome **novel contributions** for presentation at the GECCO 2024 Workshop, which will be included in the **_GECCO Conference Companion Proceedings_**. In addition, **previously published papers** spanning a broad range of topics are invited for the **_poster session_** of the workshop, designed to engage both technical and non-technical audiences.
